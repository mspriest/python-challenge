Unit 3: Python Homework

**PyBank**

For this challenge, we will analyze financial records using a Python script. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses in the budget_data.csv file (in Resources folder). Here are the expected outcomes when running the script:

* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and a mount) over the entire period

The script will print the results to the terminal and export a text file (example in Analysis folder) with the results.

**PyPoll**

For this challenge, we will analyze poll results for a small, rural town using data from the election_data.csv file (in Resources folder). The dataset is compose of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. The Python script will output the following results:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote

The script will print the results to the terminal and export a text file (example in Analysis folder) with the results.
